# Collaboration Digest

This file summarizes the key steps from our conversation (English recap):

1. **Initial Issue** – Serial protocol decoding and UI improvements.
2. **Feature Extraction** – Spatial correlation for micro-gestures.
3. **State Estimation** – Fatigue/anxiety/focus logic added in `src/state.py`.
4. **LibEMG Bridge** – UDP streaming to integrate with LibEMG.
5. **UI Upgrades** – Matplotlib buttons, label text box, screenshot utility.
6. **Fixes** – 24-bit scaling into microvolts, IMU gyro offset, TextBox-based recording control.

All enhancements are recorded in this repository; refer to `app.py`, `src/stream.py`, `src/features.py`, and `src/state.py` for the implementation details.
